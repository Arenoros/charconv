= How to Build the Library
:idprefix: build_

== B2

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost
cd boost
git submodule update --init
cd libs
git clone https://github.com/cppalliance/charconv
cd ..
./bootstrap
./b2 cxxstd=11
----

This sets up a complete boost development and allows the tests to be run.
To install the development environment run:

[source, bash]
----
sudo ./b2 install cxxstd=11
----

== vcpkg

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cppalliance/charconv
cd charconv
vcpkg install charconv --overlay-ports=ports/charconv
----

This will install charconv and all the required boost packages if they do not already exist.

== Conan

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cppalliance/charconv
conan create charconv/conan --build missing
----

This will build a boost_charconv package using your default profile and put it in the local Conan cache along with all direct and transitive dependencies.
Since Charconv only depends on a few header-only Boost libraries, you can save some time by requesting header-only Boost:

[source, bash]
----
conan create charconv/conan -o 'boost*:header_only=True' --build missing
----

Following one of those approaches you can use the package as usual.
For example, using a `conanfile.txt`:

[source, bash]
----
[requires]
boost_charconv/1.0.0
----
